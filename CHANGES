## Working version

### Changed

- #12: Split 'string_concat' lint to check separately patterns 'a^b^c' (level=Allow) and 'List.fold_left (^)' (level=Warn).
  (reported by @edwintorok)
- Add command line switch '-skip-level-allow <bool>' to enable/disable lints with level=Allow. False has higher priority than per-lint command line switch (for example, `-no-string_concat`)
